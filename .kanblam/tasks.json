The idea of apply is that it stages cherry picks and stages the changes in the current main worktree, so that we can test them, and then lets the user either accept or undo them. Undo should clean up our current worktree again and revert it to how it was before the apply. And accepting should accept the changes into the commit.

We need to detect whether Claude code is running. If it is, do not kill it. If it isn't AND we ran new sdk commands since the terminal was openen, kill (or reload/refresh claude if possible) the claude session and resume it with the right id, the way you always start it.\nThe other way around: if we have openend a terminal, claude might have continue a conversation in the CLI that was started as an SDK session. How can we make sure the SDK session picks up on those new steps in the session, if any? Can the SDK continue where the cli left of in a session that was then handed to and resumed in Claude code?\nAlso consider that we shouldn't' try to resume and sdk session when a claude session is actively working in that session.
