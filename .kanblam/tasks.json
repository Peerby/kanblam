      "title": "We created an apply function for tasks in review before. We haven't really updated it, so it might be outdated. In general, I wonder if it won't have the same kind of merge issues that we see with worktrees and it's why we created the smart merge. Do you think we should also create a smart apply? The idea of apply is that it stages cherry picks and stages the changes in the current main worktree, so that we can test them, and then lets the user either accept or undo them. Undo should clean up our current worktree again and revert it to how it was before the apply. And accepting should accept the changes into the commit. Do you think we could make something like that work? We could use the claude sdk session that's still running for the task, like we do with smart merge.",

When we the user uses o to open the the session with Claude code and the terminal, the Claude instance might not be up-to-date if we ran more work in the sdk (right?)\nWe could just kill the claude session and restart it, but that assumes that that claude session isn't doing something useful. We need to detect whether Claude code is running. If it is, do not kill it. If it isn't AND we ran new sdk commands since the terminal was openen, kill (or reload/refresh claude if possible) the claude session and resume it with the right id, the way you always start it.\nThe other way around: if we have openend a terminal, claude might have continue a conversation in the CLI that was started as an SDK session. How can we make sure the SDK session picks up on those new steps in the session, if any? Can the SDK continue where the cli left of in a session that was then handed to and resumed in Claude code?\nAlso consider that we shouldn't' try to resume and sdk session when a claude session is actively working in that session. That's going to create divergence in the session.",
